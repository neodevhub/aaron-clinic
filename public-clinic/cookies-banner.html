                    A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your browser when you
                    visit almost any website. Its purpose is to enable the website to
                    remember your visit when you return to that page. Cookies typically
                    store technical information, personal preferences, content
                    customization, usage statistics, links to social networks, access to
                    user accounts, and more. The objective of cookies is to tailor the
                    website's content to your profile and needs. Without cookies, the
